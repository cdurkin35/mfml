# Math for Machine Learning (MFML)
## Library for implementing Machine Learning algorithms

Python library that provides functionality for various mathematics used in machine learning.

In no way is this library meant to be optimized for speed, but rather as a tool to apply my knowledge learned from CIS4930 (Math for Machine Learning) at UF.

Implementations:
    - Linear Algebra (Vector and Matrix Operations)
    - Probability
    - Regression Models
    - Classification Models
    - Clustering
    - Embedding
    - Neural Networks
